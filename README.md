Attention: This is a MatLab Code

Fits the 2nd-order Gruneisen-Debye Equation of State to experimental X-ray and Neutron Powder Diffraction Data
Requirememnts:
Temperature in K
Unit-cell volume in Angstroms
Unit-cell volume errors in Angstroms

Atoms in the unit-cell and formula units are also required. Gruneisen parameter is asked as an input, but if not known
please set equal to 1. 

data. mat exemplar file with Forsterite data is provided. N=28 and n=7. 

Calculates the model and finds the Debye Temperature, the Unit-cell volume at 0 K and the parameters Q and b which can be 
used to find an estimate of the incompressibility. For more accurate estimations of the incompressibility, though, the 
Gruneisen parameter needs to be known.
